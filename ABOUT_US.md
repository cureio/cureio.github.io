## About Us
CureIO is an open source organization that creates code to better the lives of the elderly population. We were started by three passionate teenagers; Sam Poder, Arsh Shrivastava and Neil Ghosh. 

CureIO began in May of 2018, as an idea for the Google Science Fair. Our idea was named Cure Band,  a device which detects irregular heart rate, alert people around you, a relative and as well as emergency services. We were inspired to make this device as Arsh's grandfather suffered multiple cardiac arrests at home. Instead of waiting for a solution for this problem we decided to develop it.

Even though the project didn't eventually get submitted to the Google Science Fair, the team found a different competition called Young Founders Summit. The competition was more business focused which was a new area for the team to focus on.

We all had get on our sixth gear to complete Cure Band whilst getting ready for the competition as well. We were happy to complete a working prototype of Cure Band for the Finals. During those Finals we were chosen as the winner of the inaugural Young Founders Summit 2019.

Over the next few months, we would continue to develop Cure Band and eventually expand the brand from a product to a company named CureIO. CureIO was started to allow us to create products in other areas of elderly health. 

However, one thing became obvious. We couldn't do it alone. So we decided that we should make our code open source. By making our code open source it would be more accessible to the world and not only those who can afford it. As our first project we would release our Cure Band code as the cureio/heart repository. We are excited to see what this journey into the world of open source brings.
